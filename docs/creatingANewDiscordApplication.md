## Creating a new Discord application
1. Once you enable developer mode with your account, navigate to the [Application page.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)<br><br>![newApplication1](../graphics/newApplication1.png)

2. When you are on the Application page, you can see the button, **New Application**.<br><br>![newApplication2](../graphics/newApplication2.png)

3. Click the button, then you will see a pop up asking you to create the application name. Give the application a name and click **Create**.<br><br>![newApplication3](../graphics/newApplication3.png)

## Register the new application as a bot
1. After the application name is created, you will see the general information page. On the left side of the page, you will be able to see **Bot**.<br><br>![newApplication1](../graphics/registration1.png)

2. Go to the **Bot** tab and click **Add Bot**. You should confirm by clicking **Yes, do it!**<br><br>![newApplication1](../graphics/registration2.png)

3. After this step, you will see the default settings for Public Bot(checked) and Require OAuth2 Code Grant(unchecked). However, make both **unchecked** to keep your bot private.<br><br>![newApplication1](../graphics/registration3.png)

4. Congratulations! Your bot has been created. Now, click the **Copy** to copy the token. 
(This token is your botâ€™s password, so be extra careful not to share it with anyone. It will give others authorization to log in to your bot. If the token gets shared, click the **Regenerate** to create a new token for your bot.)<br><br>![newApplication1](../graphics/registration4.png)
