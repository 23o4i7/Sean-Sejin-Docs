## Authorize and connect the bot to a server
1. After the application name is created, you will see the general information page. On the left side of the page, you will be able to see “Bot”.

2. Go to the “Bot” tab and click “Add Bot”. You should confirm by clicking “Yes, do it!”

3. After this step, you will see the default settings for Public Bot(checked) and Require OAuth2 Code Grant(unchecked). However, make both unchecked to keep your bot private.

4. Congratulations! Your bot has been created. Now, click the “Copy” to copy the token. 
(This token is your bot’s password, so be extra careful not to share it with anyone. It will give others authorization to log in to your bot. If the token gets shared, click the “Regenerate” to create a new token for your bot.)
