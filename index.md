# Introduction
{: .no_toc }
The purpose of this document is to guide beginners on Discord how to create a Discord Bot. The sections of this document will introduce you to the simplest and easiest way to create your own Discord Bot.

A Discord Bot is created by a user with a developer account to automate various actions on Discord. Discordâ€™s public API is used to make Bots take some actions.
